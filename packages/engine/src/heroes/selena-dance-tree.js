// Selena – Dance of the Deep's trait path. Since 2026-10-15 every trait tree (Selena, Thea – Wisdom of The Gods, Youga – The
// Ultimate One) runs on packages/engine/src/heroes/hero-trait-tree.js; these exports keep Selena's earlier names. Her picks now live in
// `hero.treeTraits["selena-dance-of-the-deep"]` (row-indexed, the same form `hero.selenaDanceTraits` had; that field is
// migrated on read: packages/engine/src/heroes/hero-trait-tree.js storedTreeRows / migrateTreeTraits).
