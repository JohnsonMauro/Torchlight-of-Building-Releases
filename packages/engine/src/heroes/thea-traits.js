// Thea (Wisdom of The Gods, Incarnation of the Gods, Blasphemer): hero trait audit batch B7 (2026-10-19;
// research/hero-traits-audit-2026-10-19.md §5 B7, §8 B7, §6 Q-H3 / Q-H9). Pure: reads the build's trait lines (origin "trait") and
// the hero-exclusive revived lines the module reads (packages/engine/src/heroes/hero-exclusive-revivals.js MODULE_LINES: The Place of Oracle and its three
// Blessing variants, Crossing the Divine Threshold, Inverted Shrine) and returns
//   - theaBlessingInputs: the Blessing model's extra lines (the Divine Blessing cycle as a gain source, the revived Max Blessing
//     Stacks lines) and the max-stack rules (packages/engine/src/defense/blessing-model.js applyTheaCapRules: Predicted Justice's shared bonus, the Divine
//     Realm's Agility / Tenacity conversion and transfer, Blasphemer's inversion into Max Desecration Stacks);
//   - theaState: God's Boon's cadence and buffs, the Focus Blessing that God's Boon consumes, the Divine Realm, the dummy deemed at
//     Low Life, Desecration on the dummy, for packages/engine/src/planner.js (the Focus override, the Lucky share) and packages/engine/src/heroes/hero-trait-modules.js
//     (the badges, the derived lines and the clocked parts);
//   - theaLineRead: one clause's status, reason, derived bodies and clocked parts.
//
// Sourced:
// - Trait texts (TLIDB, SS14; packages/engine/data/heroes/all-hero-traits-ss14.generated.js) and the game tier records (§4.3): God's Boon's
//   buff 82115 lasts the second parameter, 10 s (§6, answered from the game files); Predicted Reincarnation's buff 82113 and
//   Farewell Prophecy's 82114 stack per Focus consumed (node 213); Prophecy of Purity writes the God's Boon buffs' stack limit
//   (attr 3442 flat 1, tag 5008700).
// - TLIDB keyword tooltips (Torchlight_Hyperlink_hover, fetched 2026-10-19 into research/tlidb-ss14/fetch-cache):
//   Focus / Agility / Tenacity Blessing (initial max stacks 4: +5% additional damage; +4% Attack and Cast Speed and +2% additional
//   damage; 4% damage reduction), Desecration (e08b6093: "+15% additional Erosion Damage taken (multiplies) for each stack of
//   Desecration. Initial max stacks: 3. Lasts for 5s. Can only affect 1 target"), Sacrificial Pawn (0f6b3f2c: "-10% additional
//   damage dealt and +10% additional Erosion Damage taken. This is considered a Crowd Control Effect"), Mountain of Sins (8ad74b7c:
//   "Reduces Erosion Resistance by 20%"), Divine Realm (8c37095a: the Agility / Tenacity conversion outside / within; "deals
//   additional damage to Full Life enemies when outside … to Low Life enemies when within"), God's Boon (83458fb2), Low Life
//   (be27a4cb: under 35% of Max Life), Preparation (5e33ceac: triggers the skill once when ready, else right after its cooldown).
//
// Provisional readings (src/app/stats/open-questions.js, shown only for Thea):
// - Q-H3 (recommended): a Divine Blessing every 2 s in the order Focus → Agility → Tenacity, so each type gains a stack every 6 s;
//   the Blessings are held at their max stacks (own buffs built before engaging; their durations are not in the readable data).
//   God's Boon fires at max Focus every P = max(15 s ÷ (1 + its Cooldown Recovery Speed), Max Focus × 6 s) and consumes every
//   Focus stack, so Focus refills one stack per 6 s: its time average is (3·F·(F − 1) + F·(P − 6·F)) ÷ P (another Focus gain
//   source in the build refills it at once: Focus held at max, P = the cooldown). The God's Boon buffs last 10 s: uptime
//   min(1, 10 s ÷ P). The 5 s / 20 s windows cast God's Boon at t = 0 with own buffs built (Focus pre-built), else at the first
//   max Focus (6 · (F − 1) s). Only the God's Boon-specific Cooldown Recovery Speed lines are read (as Frostfire Rampage's).
// - The Place of Oracle's "+2% additional damage" is per stack of Tenacity and Agility Blessing, scaled by each Blessing's Effect;
//   Prophecy of Purity's extra stack raises the per-Focus buffs' stack limits (Predicted Reincarnation, Farewell Prophecy, the
//   moon's Skill Area); Prophecy of Punishment's Lucky Damage and Max Damage hold for the share of time Focus equals Agility
//   (a fractional Lucky roll count with the same expected roll); Farewell Prophecy's Double Damage chance is time-averaged and its
//   Quadruple Damage reads the averaged chance (packages/engine/src/combat/double-damage.js).
// - The Divine Realm: pressed on cooldown (8 s / 8 s, the Trait Skill switch) or Prepared by Tenacious Divinity / Agile Godhood,
//   cast on the dummy: uptime 1 from t = 0. Inside vs outside the Realm cannot both hold: the "Divine Realm position" choice
//   (packages/engine/src/planner.js exclusiveConditionGroups) keeps the one with more damage, default outside. Outside, Tenacity converts to
//   Agility and Tenacity's max-stack change applies to Agility; within, the reverse. "When outside the Divine Realm" holds with no
//   Realm too; "while the Divine Realm is active" and "enemies in the Divine Realm" need it.
// - Q-H9 (recommended): the dummy never loses Life (0% lost) except where a line deems it at Low Life: Incarnation deems it for
//   6.5 s of every 10 s from the first hit (share 0.65), read by "enemies at Low Life" lines (packages/engine/src/text/line-conditions.js enemyLowLife).
// - Desecration (Blasphemer): applied on every Blessing gain (every 2 s, the trait skill ignores its cooldown) or, with no gain, on
//   the 5 s cooldown when the Trait Skill switch is on; each application inflicts ⌈max ÷ 3⌉ stacks and refreshes the duration of
//   every stack (as Ignite's shared timer), so the dummy holds max stacks after ⌈3⌉ applications; the dummy starts clean.
//   "+15% additional Erosion Damage taken (multiplies)" per stack: one line, (1.15^n − 1). Blasphemer turns every increase to Max
//   Blessing Stacks into a decrease and +1 Max Desecration Stack each (up to 4 per Blessing type); Extreme Desecration converts
//   the rest once every Blessing's max is 0, up to 25. Sacrificial Pawn (the dummy alone) is a crowd control type on the dummy;
//   Mountain of Sins reads any crowd control type on the Desecrated dummy and is read as Erosion Penetration (as Gemma's Frigid
//   Infusion). Onset of Depravity's True Damage is once per Elite: not on the dummy. Inverted Shrine's self Desecration is held
//   while you Desecrate the dummy.
