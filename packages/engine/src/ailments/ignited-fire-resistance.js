// Sun's Embrace: "Additionally increases Ignited enemies' Fire Resistance by X%" (affix 11868477; research/residual-batch-2026-10-12.md
// run 18, R-SUNS). Game data: an enemy-side row (node 111 → targets 8, then node 101) writes attr 5101 (target Fire Resistance)
// with mod 4, the "additional" operation, gated on the enemy's own state 4000130 (Ignited). Scorch buff 131 carries 4000130 too
// (config_char_buff), so the line holds under Fire's Allure.
//
// Sourced order (manual_rule_des in config_multi_language_en; TLIDB Resistance, Resistance Penetration, Damage Calculation):
// - stat = (base + Σ flat) × (1 + Σ increased) × Π(1 + additional): manual 1000000320 ("Similar to the calculation of stats,
//   damage = Base Damage × (1 + all damage increase percentages) × (1 + additional damage increase percentage 1) …") and the
//   client's generic collector 0x141bdddc0 (modes 1 / 2 summed as the flat range, mode 3 summed, mode 4 listed and multiplied;
//   research/additional-damage-buckets-2026-10-06.md). Scorch's −20 (affix 167394032), Fire's Allure's −10 per stack (6775109)
//   and "−X% All Resistance when the enemy has max Affliction" (371197) all write 5101 with mod 1, so they are inside the flat
//   sum this line multiplies.
// - effective = min(stat, Max Resistance) (manual 1000010424); Max Fire Resistance defaults to 60 (config_attributes 5127) and the
//   panel caps it at 90 (row 30500; 2026-10-17 game attribute data). The dummy carries no traced Max Resistance modifier, so it
//   reads the attribute default. No lower bound was found in the client (fire-target-mitigation trace).
// - Resistance Penetration then lowers the effective resistance in the damage calculation without changing it, on every form
//   of damage (Hit, DoT, Secondary, Reflect; manual 1000000920): it is subtracted afterwards and never multiplied.
// - The client's Fire hit and Fire DoT branches read the same target Fire Resistance attribute (fire-target-mitigation trace), so
//   the line reaches hits and Ignite alike; Reaps settle the post-resistance DoT (torturers-touch-and-allure-config).
//
// Not sourced (provisional): that the level-85 dummy's 30% sits in attr 5101 (and not in Elemental Resistance 5741, which the
// client adds to it unmultiplied).
