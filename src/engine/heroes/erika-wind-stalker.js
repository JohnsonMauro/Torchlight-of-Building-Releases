// Erika (Wind Stalker): the trait state the damage engines read (Erika batch, 2026-10-14). The trait lines arrive as build
// lines (origin "trait", src/engine/character-stats.js heroTraitStatLines at the planner's trait levels); the plain ones ("+X%
// additional damage", "+X% additional Attack Speed", "The Main Skill is supported by Lv. 10 Multistrike") already reach the
// engines. This module settles the Stalker and Multistrike clauses the plain readers cannot, and the hero-exclusive revived
// affix Cat's Night Safari (Hunting Instinct). src/engine/skills/skill-hit-model.js applies the result to every Attack hit that
// Multistrikes (multistrikeSequence); src/engine/heroes/hero-trait-modules.js carries the badges.
//
// Sourced (TLIDB tlidb.com/en/Wind_Stalker and its keyword tooltips, captured 2026-10-14; game manual entries in
// config_multi_language_en, quoted in src/engine/skills/skill-hit-model.js multistrikeSequence):
// - Stalker (hyperlink 644): "+13% additional damage during Multistrike for every stack of Stalker. Initial max stacks: 3.
//   Lasts for 4s".
// - Base trait: "Gains 1 stack of Stalker for every 1 m of movement"; "Your Multistrike Count will not be interrupted during
//   Stalker" (manual 1001020121: moving or using other skills interrupts Multistrike).
// - Cat's Vision: "At Max Multistrike Count, +1 to Max Stalker Stacks, up to +3, until Stalker ends".
// - Cat's Punches: "At Max Multistrike Count, gains 1 stack of Stalker"; "+1 to the initial Multistrike Count for every 3
//   stack(s) of Stalker".
// - Cat's Scratch: "+X% additional Multistrike damage increment for 4 s when the Max Multistrike Count is reached" (manual
//   1001020126: the increment is multiplied by 1 + X%). It adds with Thunder Slash's Steep-chance increment in that one
//   "additional increment" pool (user-supplied answer 2026-10-14, the user's pasted AI answer; provisional).
// - Cat's Night Safari (Memory Revival, Hero Trait Exclusive: Cateye Erika | Wind Stalker): "Gains 1 stack of Interest upon
//   dealing damage to an Elite enemy. Interval: 1s. Gains Hunting Instinct when having 5 stack(s) of Interest"; Hunting
//   Instinct (TLIDB keyword): "+1 to Initial Multistrike Count and Max Multistrike Count. +15% additional Attack Damage to
//   attacks that reach max Multistrike Count. Lasts for 30s. Unable to gain Interest during Hunting Instinct". The training
//   dummy counts as a Boss, so an Elite (src/engine/combat/dummy-target.js).
//
// Provisional readings (listed in the recount assumptions; questions to the user):
// - Sequence: see multistrikeSequence. User-accepted 2026-10-14 (research/google-ai-mode-answers-2026-10-13.md §10): the
//   initial count shifts every count and the attack count follows the chance; "during Multistrike" = the repeated attacks
//   only, not the triggering first hit. Still provisional: the max-count attack = the last of a sequence; one Max Multistrike Count event per
//   sequence that multistrikes). Hunting Instinct's "+1 Max Multistrike Count" is the same shift under that reading.
// - Stalker stacks held = min(max stacks, gains per second × 4 s) (each stack on its own 4 s timer; a refresh-all reading
//   gives the same count whenever gains × 4 s ≥ max). Max stacks 3 + Cat's Vision's +3 once Max Multistrike Count events
//   keep Stalker up. Moving (the Movement group's Moving option) holds the max from movement alone.
// - Standing still with no Stalker gain at Max Multistrike Count: Stalker only from own buffs built before engaging (4 s),
//   then none.
// - Windows (5 s / 20 s, recount): Stalker gains at each Max Multistrike Count event from t = 0 (every multistriking hit's
//   events merged, the k-th of a hit at k ÷ its event rate); own buffs built before engaging (prebuiltSelfBuffs) start full,
//   Hunting Instinct included; otherwise Interest starts at the first hit.
//
// User-confirmed 2026-10-14 (Cat's Night Safari): "the 5 Interest stacks are not used up when Hunting Instinct starts; they
// are simply locked." So when Hunting Instinct ends after 30 s the stacks are still 5 and it restarts at once: one continuous
// window from the first moment 5 Interest is reached (1 Interest per 1 s of damage to an Elite, the first at the first hit)
// to the horizon, and 100% uptime in the sustained figure. Interest has no duration of its own while the dummy is hit.
