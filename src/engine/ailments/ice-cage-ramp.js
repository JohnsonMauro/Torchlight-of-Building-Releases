// Ice Puppet's Ice Cage build-up on a clean dummy (CLAUDE.md: in the 5 s / 20 s windows the dummy starts clean, so its
// debuffs build from zero).
//
// In-game tooltip at Ice Puppet Lv2 (user, 2026-10-13): "Focus energy to create an ice prison Near yourself and the Pact
// Holder, which debuffs Frostbitten enemies inside every second and makes them take +10% additional Cold Damage, up to 4
// stacks, for 6s. Cooldown: 10s". So 1 stack per second from t = 0: 1 stack during 0–1 s, 2 during 1–2 s, 3 during 2–3 s,
// 4 from 3 s on. Each stack lasts 6 s and is refreshed while the prison stands; with the 10 s cooldown the 4 stacks hold
// if the prison stands at least 4 s. The prison's own duration is not in the tooltip, so 4 stacks are held after the ramp
// (best case; "prison duration ≥ 4 s assumed"). The stacks add into one multiplier (+10% per stack; provisional).
//
// Sustained / steady figures keep the full stacks; the 5 s / 20 s windows and the dummy recount timeline use the ramp,
// as a factor relative to the full-stack value already in every Cold ledger (src/engine/combat-states.js derives the line).
// The math is the shared timed-effect model (src/engine/combat/timed-effects.js): a "ramp" schedule of one stack per second from t = 0.
