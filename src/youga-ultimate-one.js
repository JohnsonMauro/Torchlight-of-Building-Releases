// Youga – The Ultimate One: the Clockwork Core, Recall and trait-skill state the damage engines read (2026-10-17). The trait
// lines arrive as build lines (origin "trait", src/character-stats.js heroTraitStatLines at the planner's trait levels); the
// plain ones ("+X% Cooldown Recovery Speed", "+X% Skill Effect Duration", "-X% Movement Speed") already reach the readers.
// This module settles the clauses the plain readers cannot. src/planner.js applies the result to the hits of the skill
// Clockwork Core supports (src/skill-hit-model.js `heroEffects`), src/hero-trait-modules.js carries the badges and
// src/skill-coverage.js the Clockwork Core / trait-skill badges.
//
// Sourced (TLIDB tlidb.com/en/The_Ultimate_One, Clockwork_Core, Stasis_Vault, Supreme_Descent, Selves_of_All_Realms and their
// hover texts, cached in research/tlidb-ss14/fetch-cache/; the patch notes' trait-tree appendix,
// research/patch-ss14/patch-notes-raw.md; game manual rules quoted in src/tangle-model.js):
// - Clockwork Core (keyword 80070): casting the supported skill summons the Core (or moves it); the skill attaches to the Core
//   as a Spell Tangle, only to the Core, and while the Core exists it is attached at Max Tangle Quantity; when the skill lands
//   a Critical Strike, -0.1 s Cooldown for all skills (interval 0.2 s); bonuses to the Core also apply to the skill; the Core
//   lasts 8 s, affected by Skill Effect Duration.
// - Tangle (manual 1001020420–1001020424): an activated Tangle triggers its Spell at the Spell's casting interval; base Max
//   Tangle Quantity 2, highest 4.
// - Stasis Vault: lasts 8 s, cooldown 16 s; a 10 m vault centred on the Core; while it is active, Projectile skills supported
//   by the Core always Penetrate and trigger Recall when they touch a wall or the vault.
// - Recall (keyword 80083): "A special way for Projectiles to return. Unaffected by 'cannot return' effects, restricted only by
//   its own Recall count". Psionic Missile: "Projectiles of this skill cannot Penetrate, Jump, Return, or Recall"; secondary
//   projectiles of Split Firebolt / Moon's Dawn / Splitting Lightning Bolt "cannot return or be Recalled".
// - Selves of All Realms: lasts 7 s, cooldown 16 s, cooldown cannot be increased above 24 s; while it is active, skills
//   supported by the Core gain their Alternate Spacetime Youga effect (19 skills, allHeroTraitsSs13 skillEffects).
// - Supreme Descent: cooldown 3.3 s; the Core links up to 4 enemies within 20 m with Chains of Enslavement. Governance: +1%
//   additional Clockwork Core Damage per stack, 4 s. Centralization: +1% additional Clockwork Core Damage and +0.5% Projectile
//   Speed per stack, 4 s.
//
// User-supplied (2026-10-18; an AI answer the user pasted, not an in-game test; listed in the assumptions):
// - Tangle cadence (switch `clockworkTangles`, on by default): every Tangle attached to the Core is activated (the Core always
//   holds Max Tangle Quantity), and each triggers the skill at its casting interval: Max Tangle Quantity Core triggers per
//   casting interval (2 at base).
// User-decided (2026-10-18, from game-code evidence, research/youga-recall-mechanics-2026-10-18.md R1; replaces the
//   user-supplied "the player's manual casts also hit at the normal cast rate"): only the Core's Tangle-fired casts deal the
//   skill's hits. Every Core and Stasis Vault effect is gated on a tag only Tangle-fired casts carry, and the player's own cast
//   of the supported skill takes the summon/move branch: it summons or moves the Core and fires no bolt. The hit has one rate
//   component, "Clockwork Core triggers" (hit.rate.rateComponents; triggerComponent.manualCasts false).
//   Off: the planner's ordinary Tangle reading (src/tangle-model.js), one use per casting interval (the pre-2026-10-18 single
//   component, I Will Hunt You Down's penalty on it).
// Game data (2026-10-18, replaces the user-supplied "manual casts follow the normal Spell Burst rules"): the Clockwork Core
//   support's own affix list (skill stone 402007) carries affix 534222016 "This skill cannot trigger Spell Burst" on the
//   supported skill (skill tag 5000002, the tag the same stone's "released in the form of Clockwork Core" affix 9188533 uses;
//   node 131, the node of Youga's "Non-Main Skills cannot ... trigger Spell Burst"), so the skill Clockwork Core supports never
//   activates Spell Burst (research/youga-recall-mechanics-2026-10-18.md).
// - Recall: a projectile Recalls once per trajectory (base Max Recall Count 1) and the returning hit deals full damage as a
//   fresh instance; I Will Hunt You Down's +1 per Jump (up to +2) adds to it. Recalled hits apply to the Core-triggered casts
//   inside the Vault (the only casts that fire projectiles), at the Vault uptime.
// - I Will Hunt You Down's "-50% additional Cast Speed for Clockwork Core while Stasis Vault is active" slows only the Core's
//   trigger frequency (uptime-weighted on the Core trigger component, the only hit component).
//
// Readings that are this module's own interpretation (provisional; listed in the dummy-recount assumptions and the badges):
// - The Core is always present (the player recasts the skill within the Core's 8 s; best case).
// - "Bonuses to Clockwork Core are also applied to the supported skill": every "+X% additional Clockwork Core Damage" source
//   (base trait share, Artificial Moon, Governance, Centralization, I Need Not Lift a Finger) is an additional-damage line on
//   the supported skill's hits.
// - Base trait share: 180% × (the build's increased Cooldown Recovery Speed + increased Skill Effect Duration), capped at 48%
//   ("bonuses" read as the increased pool: I Am the Measure of All Time names "bonuses and additional bonuses" separately).
// - Recall on one dummy (switch `yougaRecall`, on by default): while the Vault is active a projectile that reaches the dummy
//   goes through it (always Penetrates), touches the vault, is Recalled and hits the dummy again, once per Recall: hits per
//   projectile = 1 + Max Recall Count. Recalled hits are full hits (no Shotgun falloff). Only the skill's first hit group
//   recalls (secondary projectiles cannot), and only Horizontal Projectile skills (Penetrate is a Horizontal projectile
//   mechanic).
// - Trait skills (Stasis Vault, Supreme Descent, Selves of All Realms) are pressed whenever they are off cooldown (condition
//   `traitSkillOnCooldown`, the Iris Nourishment switch's rule). Uptime = min(1, duration ÷ cooldown); Skill Effect Duration
//   raises "Lasts" and Cooldown Recovery Speed shortens the cooldown; the Core's crit cooldown reduction shortens every cooldown
//   by 0.1 s per crit event (at most 5 per second): cooldown ÷ (1 + 0.1 × crit events per second).
// - Stacks (Governance, Centralization): each stack on its own 4 s timer, held = min(max, gains per second × 4 s). Governance
//   needs the dummy linked by Chains of Enslavement (Supreme Descent on cooldown; the link duration is unpublished, read as held
//   while Supreme Descent is recast) and comes from every hit the build lands on it (the dummy is an Elite).
// - I Am the Measure of All Time: the extended cooldown is 16 s × (1 + increased CDR) × Π(1 + additional CDR), capped at 24 s;
//   "+X% effect for Selves of All Realms" multiplies each Alternate Spacetime value and its cap.
// - Windows: the trait skills are cast at t = 0 (own buffs built before engaging) and then on cooldown; the 5 s / 20 s windows
//   follow that schedule (src/timed-effects.js steps on the supported skill's hits).
