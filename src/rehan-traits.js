// Rehan (Anger, Seething Silhouette): hero trait audit batch B10 (2026-10-19; research/hero-traits-audit-2026-10-19.md §5 B10, §8 B10,
// §6 Q-H1 / Q-H15). Pure: reads the build's trait lines (origin "trait"), the hero-exclusive revived lines the module reads
// (src/hero-exclusive-revivals.js MODULE_LINES: Hero's Resourcefulness, Furious Roar, Ancestral Hate's Life cost, Starfall Wasteland)
// and the rates the planner's hit pass measured (src/planner.js hitRateFacts.rehan), and returns
//   - rehanState: the Rage cycle (Rage gained outside Berserk, Berserk's drain and duration, its uptime), the Rage bonus level in each
//     phase, Burst (Anger) and the Seething Spirit (Seething Silhouette), Disarmed, the best-case switches and the recount assumptions;
//   - rehanPhaseLines: the Rage-driven lines for a phase weighting (the time average for the build, Berserk only for Burst and the
//     Spirit, the player's attacking time under Ritual of Offering's Disarm);
//   - rehanLineRead: one clause's status, reason and derived bodies (src/hero-trait-modules.js "rage" / "burst" / "spirit").
//
// Sourced:
// - Trait texts (TLIDB, SS14; src/data/heroes/all-hero-traits-ss13.generated.js); game tier records (audit §4.3; SS14 tier data):
//   Fury's Onslaught's second parameter (-33.33 / -36.31 / -39.02 / -41.52 / -43.82) is a Berserk + Seething Spirit additional damage
//   (affix 187841424: attr 5719 with tags 4030001 / 6001190), so the Spirit's casts take the player's +X% and this offset.
// - TLIDB keyword tooltips (Torchlight_Hyperlink_hover, fetched 2026-10-19, research/tlidb-ss14/fetch-cache/): Rage (ece24b16: "a
//   Berserker exclusive energy that has a default upper limit of 100"), Berserk (b3645c45: "gains bonuses twice the Max Rage while
//   Berserk is active; Berserk expires when you run out of Rage"), Burst (46230009: "deals … area explosion damage equal to 340% of
//   Weapon Damage to enemies within 3m. While Dual Wielding, the Base Damage is the average damage of both weapons. For every +1 to
//   Skill Level, Burst +10% additional damage (multiplies)"; tags Attack, Melee, Physical, Triggered, Area, Strength, Dexterity), Burst
//   Blast (219965c8: "1166-1944 Spell Physical Damage … The damage effect of this skill is 288%"; tags Spell, Physical, Triggered,
//   Area, Strength, Dexterity), Seething Spirit (bfe0c1e9: "casts your Non-Mobility and Non-Channeled Main Melee Attack Skills when it
//   appears"), Disarm (a54e950b: "unable to use Attack Skills when disarmed").
// - Game data (readable tables): config_skill_damage group 90000 "野蛮人_爆裂" (Barbarian Burst), one Lv. 1 row, 340% Weapon Damage at
//   +0x08 (the attack-row layout of Whirlwind 51 / 52); group 90003 (the same name), Physical 1166–1944 at 288% (Burst Blast). SS14 flat
//   extraction 2026-10-15 (session scratchpad), read only. Burst's trigger (affix 102360002): on hit (trigger 1000033, once per source)
//   while Berserk (state 4030001), cooldown p0 ÷ the Burst Cooldown Recovery attribute 7010 (Rampaging converts Attack Speed 6001 into
//   7010), trigger node 2320 (skill position 3000). config_char_field 2300106 "base Rage cost" 10 (Seething's cost per Melee cast).
//
// Provisional readings (src/open-questions.js, shown only for Rehan):
// - Q-H1 (recommended): Max Rage 100 (now the TLIDB Rage keyword) + "+N Max Rage" lines. Berserk is entered at Max Rage and lasts until
//   Rage runs out: Max Rage ÷ the net drain (Anger 15 / s; Seething 10 / s + 10 per Melee Attack cast, halved with Fury's Onslaught);
//   Righteous Fury's generation, Frenzy Furious's Rage on Burst crits, Growing Anger and the other gains in Berserk slow or stop it.
//   Outside Berserk Rage is gained from the uses the hit pass measured (10 per Melee Attack use, 5 per channel stack, Starfall's 15 per
//   Ranged use), × (1 + Rage gained). Uptime = Berserk ÷ (Berserk + the fill time); the 5 s / 20 s windows use the cycle average. Own
//   buffs pre-built (default): Rage full at engagement, so a permanent Berserk holds from t = 0.
// - "Gains bonuses twice the Max Rage" (the Berserk keyword) is read for both loadouts: the per-Rage bonuses read 2 × Max Rage while
//   Berserk is active (Seething Silhouette states it; Anger reads the keyword — its game line 899838 carries no effect node, so the
//   doubling lives in the shared Berserk state). Outside Berserk the Rage fills linearly from 0, so the bonuses read Max ÷ 2.
// - Burst (Anger): triggered on the hits of the player's Attack Skills (once per attack: the trigger is once per source) while
//   Berserk, at most once per cooldown: rate in Berserk = 1 ÷ max(1 ÷ attack uses per second, 0.3 s ÷ (1 + Burst Cooldown Recovery
//   Speed)) (the Activation Medium rule, user-confirmed 2026-10-12), × the Berserk uptime. Burst Cooldown Recovery Speed: the Artificial
//   Moon line at the Berserk Rage level and Rampaging's share of the Attack Speed bonuses (increased → increased, additional →
//   additional); general Cooldown Recovery Speed lines are not read (the cooldown reads its own attribute). Burst's hits do not trigger
//   Burst. Its level: Lv. 1 (its single game row) + the build's "+N <tag> / All Skills' Level" lines that match its tags (not Active /
//   Main Skill lines: it is not on the skill board), each +10% additional damage (multiplies). "+X% additional Burst Damage per 1
//   levels" reads the character level. Burst Blast (Hero's Resourcefulness): the Spell row, can activate Spell Burst.
// - Furious Roar: a second Burst trigger on attack Critical Strikes (uses × crit chance), with its own 0.3 s cooldown.
// - Tunnel Vision (Q-H15, recommended): "-80% additional damage for non-Burst skills" applied to every hit, damage over time and
//   ailment except Burst's hits (best-case switch `rehanTunnelVision`, default applied); Burst's own ailments read it too.
// - Seething Spirit: casts the Main Skill (Melee Attack, not Mobility or Channeled; Starfall: Ranged Projectile, not Channeled or
//   Parabolic) at the player's own use rate for it, × (1 - 30%) with Fury's Onslaught; Ritual of Offering: always while Berserk;
//   Fury's Onslaught: while the Main Skill is used within every 2 s in Berserk. Each Spirit cast is a full use of the Main Skill with
//   the Berserk-phase lines, Ritual's +40% and Fury's offset (game record). Disarmed (Ritual): the player's Attack Skills pause while
//   Berserk (Rage Infusion: for its first 5 s).
// - Hysteria's Rage: damage taken from Ritual of Offering's self-damage (1% of current Life every 0.2 s in Berserk) and Life consumed by
//   Ancestral Hate (30% of current Life per Spirit skill), current Life read as Max Life (an upper bound); the dummy never attacks.
// - Rage Infusion: stacks = min(max, Rage gained per second × 4 s ÷ 25) in each phase (game buff 80204: 4 s).
