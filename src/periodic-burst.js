// Periodic Burst (support, TLIDB 2026-10-14): "Support Mobility Skills. Gains a stack of buff when using the supported skill every
// 6s: +20.5% Attack and Cast Speed after using a Mobility Skill. The buff lasts 2s". TLIDB gives no max stack count; a 2 s buff
// gained at most once per 6 s never holds a second stack, so the stack count does not matter here.
//
// Reading (provisional, 2026-10-14): the Mobility skill is used whenever its cooldown allows (user rule 2026-10-14: Mobility
// skills are used constantly; gated by the mobilitySkillUsed condition), so a stack is gained every max(6 s, the skill's
// effective cooldown) and the buff is up duration ÷ that period of the time (capped at 1). Its Attack and Cast Speed reaches
// every skill as one time-averaged "+X% Attack and Cast Speed" line, which the cast-rate ledger and the weapon Attack Speed
// model both read. The 5 s / 20 s windows use the same average.
